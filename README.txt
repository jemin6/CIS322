2017 WINTER TERM (01.09.2017 - 03.22.2017) 

SUBJECT: CIS322 (4 credits) 
INSTRUCTORS: Daniel Ellsworth
CLASS TIME: TuTh 2:00pm - 3:20pm 
GTF: Andy Hampton 
COURSE WEBSITE: https://classes.cs.uoregon.edu//17W/cis322/index.php


Overview

From the course catalogue:
"Software engineering" is where we consider consequences of the fact that software is constructed by people. People can be very clever, but they cannot hold too much in their heads at once, so we must organize software in ways that allow them to focus on one part at a time. People work at a limited pace, so we must consider how construction can be done in small steps, and how teams can work together to get more done. People make mistakes, so sensible construction methods involve extensive testing. Often people donâ€™t even really understand what they want until they can see and try it, and even then their needs change over time, so software must be designed to change both during and after initial development. CIS 322 is a project-intensive course intended to build skills, knowledge, and 'habits of mind' that prepare you for 400-level computer science courses, internships, and other software projects
For Winter 2017, the course design has centered around the themes of technical skills and management skills. Techincal skills are the tools and methods needed to participate in large software projects. Management skills are the communication and personal management skills needed to be an effective contributor to a software project.

Technical skills will be developed experientally by using various tools and documents you might encounter on software projects. Fluency with version control systems is a must for modern software development (we will use git). Scripting skills are also critically important since they can expedite work and improve consistency across deployments (we will use bash). Our term project will be a full stack web application (we will use Apache, Postgres, Flask, JavaScript). Web applications are extremely common in industry and knowing a little bit about how all of the layers work will make you a more valuable developer on those projects. Successful completion of the incrementals and term project will demonstrate your technical skills

Management skills will be discussed in lecture and there will be opportunity to practice through exercises and test questions. Many management problems are rooted in communicating risks and rewards in a way that nontechnical audiences and understand. We will use regular status reporting mechanisms to develop an effective statusing pattern and comfort providing useful status information for project managers and other nontechnical audiences. We will discuss business risks and will complete a security assessment and reporting exercise for the term project codebase. We will discuss design tradeoffs and argue professionally about solutions under consideration. We will also conduct code reviews to develop an appreciation and fluency for others code.


Academic Integrity

The University of Oregon's Student Conduct Code provides information on student academic misconduct, including the rules for cheating and plagiarism. It also discusses the penalties. You will be held accountable for adhearing to the code, please read it.

All work in this course will be individual however you are strongly encouraged to form study groups, ask each other questions, and learn from one another. We expect that a study group will produce solutions with the same general structure and algorithmic design however the individual implementations at the scale of the term project invaribly end up with differences due to each person having a unique background, style, and experiences. If you are concerned about the level of code similarity between you and another student you are working with, please let us know so that we can resolve the issue prior to grading.

Structure

The fastest way to learn how to work professionally on a large software project would be to place you, 40 hours a week, on a professional software project with a good manager and technical lead for 6 to 12 months. There is no way to really replicate that experience in an academic setting, but we will do our best. This course will be heavily project focused and you should expect 14 hours of work effort will be needed each week to do well in the class. This amount of work effort is on the high side for a 4 credit course at the UO but still within reason.

If the instructor has time to add some alternate reality touches, the term project and other actionable work will be presented as work for a ficticious organization. The Office of Strategic National Alien Planning (OSNAP) is a ficticious government agency with a mission to make strategic plans for real and imagined extraterrestial encounters. In addition to hopefully being fun, using a ficticous organization will help facilitate discussion about stakeholders, organizational policies/politics, and other business concerns that can have a large impact real software projects.

Lectures are on Tuesdays and Thursdays. While lecture is not strictly required, you will be responsible for the material covered and slides will not be posted. If you miss a lecture, please consult with your peers regarding the material covered. There is no required lab for this course however we strongly suggest you take advantage of DES100. Being in the same space as your peers when working on your project will make your peers available when you have questions. We will also be hold our office hours in DES100.

We also have Piazza this term. The link for the piazza page is piazza.com/uoregon/winter2017/cis322/home. Your instructor isn't very familiar with Piazza and is looking forward to learing how to use piazza to improve communication outside of class.

Incremental deliverables and weekly status will be due on Fridays. Work recieved after 8 am Pacific Standard Time (1600 UTC) on the following Monday will be reviewed but will not recieve credit.

Grading

Grading will be done using points and standard percentages. Points accumulated over points possible will be used to map from points to grades.

Points		Task Bin
400		Term Project
200		Incremental Deliverables
100		Code Reviews
100		Weekly Status
0		Daily Checkpoint
200		Tests
1000		Total
Term Project

The Term Project is scoped as a 10 week long project designed to exercise skills for software development. Since these skills are the focus of the course, the majority of the points are earned through successfully completing the term project. These 500 points will be graded for once at the end of the term.

Incremental Deliverables

Last minute implementation of the term project is not desirable. The incremental projects are intented to demonstrate progress towards the final project deliverable. An incremental will be expected each week and each incremental deliverable will be worth 20 points. Late incremental deliverables will not be accepted for points but will be looked at.

Code Reviews

In CIS422 and in most real world projects, you will be working with code written by other people. We all approach and think about problems a little differently, which impacts the shape and structure of our programs. The code review exercise is intended to give you experience in reading and trying to understand how someone else's code is structured.

Weekly Status

Being able to estimate work effort, describe progress, and anticipate challenges is an important capability for working on software projects. Each weekly status deliverable is worth 10 points and will give you an opportunity to practice this skill.

Daily Checkpoint

Every manager has their own defects; mine happens to be desiring frequent status. The daily checkpoint is expected to take just a few minutes on each weekday; one or two sentances on progress, challenges, or thoughts you have had while working on the project that day. The daily checkpoint provides feedback for me so that I can better tailor my instruction to help you. You must submit something for every daily. "I was too busy sleeping to think about the project today." or "This daily assignment is the dumbest requirement for a class ever and who ever thought of this should die in a fire!" are perfectly good daily checkpoint messages. For each daily checkpoint where nothing is submited, you will be awarded -2 points.

Tests

The academic setting requires tests be used to evaluate students. A 50 point mid-term will be administered around week 5 and 150 point final will be given on finals week.

...exceptions...

This is the plan for grading in Winter 2017 and plans rarely survive contact with reality. If you need to be out during the term please let the instructor know in advance so that we can work something out so that you don't lose points or accrue negative points. If something happens for which advance notice can not be given, let us know as soon as you can so that we can mitigate lost points and protect your grade point.
