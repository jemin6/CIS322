###  Overview 

From the course catalogue:
"Software engineering" is where we consider consequences of the fact that software is constructed by people. People can be very clever, but they cannot hold too much in their heads at once, so we must organize software in ways that allow them to focus on one part at a time. People work at a limited pace, so we must consider how construction can be done in small steps, and how teams can work together to get more done. People make mistakes, so sensible construction methods involve extensive testing. Often people donâ€™t even really understand what they want until they can see and try it, and even then their needs change over time, so software must be designed to change both during and after initial development. CIS 322 is a project-intensive course intended to build skills, knowledge, and 'habits of mind' that prepare you for 400-level computer science courses, internships, and other software projects
For Winter 2017, the course design has centered around the themes of technical skills and management skills. Techincal skills are the tools and methods needed to participate in large software projects. Management skills are the communication and personal management skills needed to be an effective contributor to a software project.

Technical skills will be developed experientally by using various tools and documents you might encounter on software projects. Fluency with version control systems is a must for modern software development (we will use git). Scripting skills are also critically important since they can expedite work and improve consistency across deployments (we will use bash). Our term project will be a full stack web application (we will use Apache, Postgres, Flask, JavaScript). Web applications are extremely common in industry and knowing a little bit about how all of the layers work will make you a more valuable developer on those projects. Successful completion of the incrementals and term project will demonstrate your technical skills

Management skills will be discussed in lecture and there will be opportunity to practice through exercises and test questions. Many management problems are rooted in communicating risks and rewards in a way that nontechnical audiences and understand. We will use regular status reporting mechanisms to develop an effective statusing pattern and comfort providing useful status information for project managers and other nontechnical audiences. We will discuss business risks and will complete a security assessment and reporting exercise for the term project codebase. We will discuss design tradeoffs and argue professionally about solutions under consideration. We will also conduct code reviews to develop an appreciation and fluency for others code.
