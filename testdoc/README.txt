** Generate a test plan document. 
** This document should provide a sequence of steps, expected inputs and outputs, to verify that your program is working as intended. 
** Each test should be numbered so that your peer can generate a brief test report indicating which tests passed and which tests failed. 
** You may include installation instructions in this document, these not required since all of our solutions should install the same way using the preflight.sh script.


** Minimally your test plan should cover:

	Creating the initial users
		one Logistic Officer
		one Facility Officer
	Login to the system
	Add two facilities
	Add two assets
	Complete the asset transit process
	Dispose of an asset
	Run each of the reports
